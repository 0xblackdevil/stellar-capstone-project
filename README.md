## Individual

Meet Zinzuvadiya, a recent MSc. in Blockchain Technology graduate from MIT World Peace University, started investing in cryptocurrency in 2022, sparking a deep interest in Web3 technologies. As a full-stack developer specializing in React.js and Node.js, Meet delved into the intricacies of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Currently, he is expanding his expertise by learning about the Soroban smart contract platform using Rust, aiming to broaden his skill set in the evolving blockchain landscape.

## Description

CodeAbacus is a decentralized application designed to streamline collaboration among developers through a milestone-based payment system. This platform not only allows developers to engage in projects that align with their skills but also incorporates a secure escrow service, ensuring that funds are released only after agreed milestones are successfully met. Managed through smart contracts, this system promotes transparency and accountability, crucial for both freelancers and their clients. Future enhancements include the introduction of "DevScore," a scoring system that assesses developers based on their project completion rates and adherence to deadlines, facilitating a more merit-based selection process for clients.
